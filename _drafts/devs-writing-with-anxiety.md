I have always suffered with fear and panic when it comes to talking or presenting to groups of people. I often feel very anxious when conveying my ideas and thoughts to others, expecting the worst kind of response or feedback.

I don't consider myself an introvert, but I do share some traits with Matt Brailsford's fantastic article about _[What Exactly is Introversion?](https://www.theintdev.com/2017/10/03/what-exactly-is-introversion/)_.

Yet I do try to push through these fears and anxieties by taking part in local meetups, social groups and, recently, a bit of article writing.

##24 Days in Umbraco

In September 2017, I was asked to write an article for [24 Days in Umbraco](https://24days.in/umbraco-cms/2017/). This was a huge honour and an amazing opportunity for me to give back to the community, sharing some of my knowledge. It was also another chance to try to face some fears and issues I have with sharing my opinions with others.

Initially I was quite reluctant. I questioned what I could write about. In my mind, the peers I work or socialise with have far superior knowledge to me. Would it be good enough? Would they think it is dumb or stupid? Would I be judged? Would they laugh at what I had to say?

##Choosing a topic

I decided I would avoid writing about development or code for fear of being judged. Instead I wanted to write about something I knew about and felt confident talking about. Something close to my heart at the moment.

The topic for my article was _[How the Umbraco Community is Helping with Public Speaking & Social Anxiety](https://24days.in/umbraco-cms/2017/social-anxiety/)_.

At first, I was apprehensive about how this would be accepted by the community. I worried about submitting a "personal" or "life" story when the majority of past articles focussed on technical skills and development.

In my mind it was a risk, but a risk I wanted to take. I wanted to share my experiences with others in the hope that it might help at least one person to do similar to what I had done; push past those insecurities and anxieties that can hold us back.

##Getting feedback
On 2 December 2017, my article was published live for the internet to read. I was nervous about what my peers would think.

The article had been proofread multiple times by myself, a few friends and family, but the real fear in my mind was what the community (who I had written about) thought about it.

I needn't have worried. The article received some fantastic comments, lots of messages of support and even direct contact from some peers who I look up to fondly in the community.

It had the intended impact I was looking for. It struck a few chords with others and it even prompted some to get in touch to tell me they had decided to get back into working past their social anxiety and re-start presenting to groups.

I was delighted!

##You can do it too

I take part in local meetups, social situations and write articles purely to try to combat my fears. 

These situations are difficult and often very scary for me. They take me out of my comfort zone and I imagine a lot of people also feel stressed or tired even thinking about those situations.

But I still do this, sharing my thoughts in the hope that I could be helping others who suffer the same issues that I go through.

Developers who can be introverted, anxious or fearful _can_ get involved with communities or social situations that usually scare them. It is most likely going to be tough, tiring and hard work. But the rewards (and unexpected, but very much welcome, feedback) could also help you through these roadblocks.

Start writing blog posts or articles. Pick a topic you know you will be comfortable writing about. Maybe, like me, it could be along the lines of mental health, mindfulness, or issues surrounding anxiety and introversion. You will find you are not alone or lost by feeling the way that you do.
