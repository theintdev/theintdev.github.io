Both in an agency setting and an open source community, one of the most important factors for success is how well your team collaborates. Working in a high energy, collaborative industry can pose unique challenges for introverts.

Being comfortable discussing challenges, ways to cope, and learning from one another how to best empower each other, no matter where we are on the introvert/extrovert spectrum is a worthy investment.

I was fascinated by a discussion at the Umbraco CodeGarden conference earlier this year, where Matt and others shared a little about how reading Marti Olsen Lany's book [The Introvert Advantage](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0761123695) had affected them.  Then, during (and after) recoridng a [HappyPorchRadio episode](http://happyporchradio.com/codegarden/) with Carole Logan and Ondrej Pialek it became really clear to me that there could be a lot more discussion on this topic within the developer community.

So, as part of this ongoing discussion, I recently had the honour of hosting a live HappyPorchRadio Hotseat webinar entitled "Introverts Among Us".  I was joined by Jenn Granneman, who is the founder of [IntrovertDear.com](https://IntrovertDear.com) and the author of the book, [The Secret Lives of Introverts](http://www.amazon.com/Secret-Lives-Introverts-Inside-Hidden/dp/1510721029/): Inside Our Hidden World. And by Matt Brailsford who created theintdev.com! 

We had a fun conversation, with some great contributions from others on the call, I hope that other agency folks and developers in particular find it as useful as I did.
